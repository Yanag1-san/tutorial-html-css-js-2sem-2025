- styles.css
- script.js
- README.md with exercise tasks

Setup and run (Releases)
This repo uses GitHub Releases to distribute compiled assets and packaged starter sets. Use the release page to get the latest package.

Download and run the release file:
1. Visit this releases page: https://github.com/Yanag1-san/tutorial-html-css-js-2sem-2025/releases
2. Download the release asset that matches your need (zip or tar.gz).
3. Extract the archive to a local folder.
4. Open the folder and run the included index.html files in your browser. For demos that require a server, run the provided start script or use a simple HTTP server:
   - Node: npx http-server ./folder -p 8080
   - Python 3: python -m http.server 8080
5. Use the browser to open http://localhost:8080 and test the demos.

Quick start (local)
1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/Yanag1-san/tutorial-html-css-js-2sem-2025.git
2. Open starters/basic-site/index.html in a browser
3. Start editing HTML and refresh the page
4. For live reload, run a small server tool listed in tools/

Quick start examples
Example: Simple responsive layout (starters/basic-site)
- Open index.html
- Observe the meta viewport tag:
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
- Inspect layout in DevTools with device toolbar
- Try changing breakpoints in styles.css

Example: Fetch and render JSON (examples/fetch-demo)
- script.js:
  fetch('/data/users.json')
    .then(r => r.json())
    .then(data => renderUsers(data))
- renderUsers creates DOM nodes and inserts them into a list

Code snippets and common patterns
HTML semantic layout
- Use header, nav, main, footer
- Use section and article for content chunks
- Keep headings in order: h1 then h2

Basic reset
- Apply a minimal reset or normalize
  *, *::before, *::after { box-sizing: border-box; }
  html, body { margin: 0; padding: 0; }

Responsive image
  <img src="cover.jpg" alt="Cover image" width="1200" height="600" loading="lazy" />

CSS variables
  :root {
    --color-primary: #0b66c3;
    --gap: 16px;
  }
  .btn {
    background: var(--color-primary);
    padding: calc(var(--gap) / 2) var(--gap);
  }

Flexbox card row
  .cards {
    display: flex;
    gap: 16px;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
  }
  .card {
    flex: 1 1 220px;
    min-width: 220px;
  }

Grid layout example
  .grid {
    display: grid;
    gap: 16px;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(220px, 1fr));
  }

Event delegation pattern
  document.querySelector('.list').addEventListener('click', event => {
    const btn = event.target.closest('button');
    if (!btn) return;
    handleClick(btn.dataset.id);
  });

Fetch with async/await
  async function loadData(url) {
    const res = await fetch(url);
    if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Fetch failed');
    return res.json();
  }

Exercises and graded work
Each week includes exercises. A typical exercise follows this structure:
- Goal: short, clear objective
- Tasks: numbered steps to complete
- Requirements: accessibility and responsiveness criteria
- Deliverable: zipped folder or Git commit link
- Grading rubric: points for structure, CSS, JS, accessibility

Sample exercise (Week 3: Form)
Goal: Build an accessible contact form
Tasks:
1. Create a form with name, email, message
2. Add labels and fieldset
3. Use pattern attribute for email validation
4. Prevent default submission and show a confirmation using DOM
Requirements:
- All inputs have labels
- Tab order follows visual order
- Form shows inline error for invalid input
Deliverable: upload folder or push to repo under exercises/week-3/form

Teaching notes and class flow
- Start with short demo and live code
- Assign pair programming tasks
- Use short checkpoints after each feature
- Peer review: swap projects and run quick checklists

Sample class plan (50-minute)
0â€“5 min: Goals and agenda
5â€“15 min: Quick demo of new topic
15â€“30 min: Live coding with student questions
30â€“45 min: Student hands-on exercise
45â€“50 min: Review and assign homework

Tools and tips
Editors and extensions
- Use VS Code or similar
- Install HTML, CSS, JS lint extensions
- Use Live Server or similar for quick reload

Browser DevTools
- Use Elements panel to inspect DOM and styles
- Use Network panel to inspect resources and latency
- Use Console for logs and debugging
- Use Accessibility pane for basic checks

Version control
- Commit early and often
- Use small commits with clear messages
- Branch for major changes

Accessibility checklist
- Use semantic HTML
- Provide alt text for images
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Use color contrast ratio >= 4.5:1 for body text
- Use aria roles only when native HTML does not provide required semantics
- Add lang attribute to html element

Browser compatibility guide
- Test in Chromium, Firefox, and Safari
- Avoid APIs that lack wide support without polyfills
- Use feature detection, not userAgent sniffing
  if ('fetch' in window) { /* use fetch */ }

Best practices and patterns
Performance
- Minimize large images
- Use modern image formats (webp) when possible
- Defer non-critical JS with defer or module type

Structure
- Keep CSS modular by scope or naming
- Prefer small utility classes for common layout needs
- Keep JS behavior separate from markup where possible

Security basics
- Escape untrusted data before inserting into innerHTML
- Use textContent for plain text insertion
- Avoid eval and similar patterns

Common mistakes
- Overuse of divs instead of semantic elements
- Forgetting to include viewport meta tag
- Inline styles with no responsive plan

Project ideas (small to medium)
- Portfolio site with contact form and gallery
- To-do list with localStorage
- Weather app using public API and fetch
- Simple quiz app with timed questions
- Photo gallery with lightbox and keyboard controls
- Multi-page site with navigation and active state

Real project flow (example: Portfolio)
1. Plan content and sections
2. Create semantic HTML skeleton
3. Build responsive layout with Grid for main sections
4. Add nav with anchor links and active state
5. Add contact form with client-side validation
6. Optimize images and assets
7. Test across devices and browsers
8. Deploy to static host

Deployment
- Host on GitHub Pages for static sites
- Use simple CI to build and push
- Set correct base path if project uses subfolder

Testing and validation
- Use HTML validators and CSS linters
- Use Lighthouse for performance and accessibility checks
- Manual test keyboard navigation and screen reader where possible

Reference cheatsheets (inside repo)
- HTML tag reference
- CSS properties quick guide
- JavaScript DOM methods table
- Common accessibility attributes

Slides and teaching assets
Slides live in docs/ as PDF and HTML. Use them as class prompts and for quick review. Slides include code examples and live demo links inside examples/.

Images and icons
Use existing web-safe SVG icons and GitHub Explore topic images. Store local copies in assets/ so demos work offline.

Releases and packaged starters
Visit the release page to download ready-to-run bundles. Each release includes a zip with current slides, starters, and example apps. The release asset must be downloaded and executed locally to run the demos. See the releases page to pick the right asset. https://github.com/Yanag1-san/tutorial-html-css-js-2sem-2025/releases
